    <h2>1. Summary</h2>
    <p>
      U.N.C.L.E S.A.M stores only the data needed to operate features: Role IDs, Server IDs, User IDs, and Channel IDs.
      No message content is stored by default. Data is stored in <strong>MongoDB Atlas</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data We Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Operational Data:</strong> Role IDs, Server IDs, User IDs, Channel IDs.</li>
      <li><strong>Logs (transient):</strong> Standard server logs and error logs for reliability and abuse prevention.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Purpose of Processing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Run and improve bot features.</li>
      <li>Maintain security, prevent abuse, and debug issues.</li>
      <li>Comply with platform and legal requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Legal Bases (where applicable)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Legitimate interests</em> in providing and securing bot functionality.</li>
      <li><em>Contract</em> (your agreement to the Terms of Service by using the Bot).</li>
      <li><em>Consent</em> where required by local law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Storage & Security</h2>
    <p>
      Data is stored in MongoDB Atlas with access control and industry-standard security practices. We implement
      reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data; however, no system is 100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Operational Data is retained for as long as the bot operates in your server and as necessary for functionality
      and security. When the bot is removed from a server, related Operational Data may be cleaned up during periodic
      maintenance cycles.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell personal data. We may share data with infrastructure/service providers strictly to operate the bot,
      and as required by law or to enforce our Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Data may be processed in the United States and other locations where our providers operate. We rely on appropriate
      safeguards and agreements when required.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove the bot from your server to stop future processing.</li>
      <li>Contact us for deletion or access requests where applicable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Children</h2>
    <p>
      The Bot is not directed to children under 13 (or the age required by your region). Do not use the Bot if you are under that age.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy. Material changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above.
